# Trading Advisor Chatbot

## Purpose
This Java program is an interactive chatbot designed to provide financial trading advice. Users can input market scenarios, ask about trading strategies, or request guidance on investments. The chatbot demonstrates Java object-oriented programming, conditional logic, loops, and user input handling.  

## Features

1. **Interactive User Interface**  
   The program engages users through a menu interface, allowing multiple queries and advice sessions. The chatbot responds to different user inputs with contextual guidance, simulating a real trading assistant.

2. **Buying**  
   Users can hypothetically buy shares of a company to see how their decisions will play out.

## How It Works
1. **User Query**  
   The user selects an option from the main menu and inputs a scenario or question.  

2. **Chatbot Processing**  
   The program evaluates the input using predefined logic and methods to determine the best response.  

3. **Advice Output**  
   The chatbot displays advice, explanations, and risk assessments.  

4. **Exiting**  
   The program will repeatedly ask the user to select an option until the user selects **3**, which exits the program.
